<h2>Ascend mechanic</h2>
<p>
    Stickman's ascend equips a buff for a short period of time in expense for the guard bar.
    The duration of the buff depends on which buff it is.
    When a buff is already equiped, using ascend again will remove it but will cost more guard bar.
    Removing the effect is also much more commital than equiping it.
    Both the Stickman and the opponent can make use of the buff, rendering them mostly situational.
