<p>
    Stickman's ascend is simple, it is used by pressing 2<span class="neutral">A</span> and cost 20% meter.<br>
	The effect is that of a <a href="typing_system.html#type_switch">type switch</a> and, just like other type switches, it will change the type of the following moves for a third of a second but, unlike the others, will change those moves to true neutral.<br>
