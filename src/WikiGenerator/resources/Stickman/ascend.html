<h2>Ascend Mechanic</h2>
<p>
    Stickman's ascend is simple, it is used by pressing 2<span class="neutral">A</span> and cost 20% meter.<br>
	The effect is that of a <a href="typing_system.html#type_switch">type switch</a> and, just like other type switches, it will change the type of the following moves for a third of a second but, unlike the others, will change those moves to true neutral.<br>

<h2>Extra Gimmick</h2>
<p>
    Stickman also has another trick up his sleeves: he can use his grounded moves in the air during the startup of his jump.<br>
    In this wiki, these moves are prepended with [<code><strong>a.</strong></code>]. For example, a.3M is a grounded 3M used in the air (by inputting 8->3M under 5 frames) while j.3M is simply an aerial move which would happen when pressing 3M any other time in the air.<br>
    This allows him to access lows in the air and his other strong grounded moves for more mixup opportunities.
