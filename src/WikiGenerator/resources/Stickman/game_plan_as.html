<h2>Playing As</h2>
To play stickman you must be mindful of your few good options in neutral like your projectile on j.forward/6<span class="spirit">S</span> and other moves like forward/6<span class="not-typed">N</span> as you will desperately need everything you can have in neutral.<br>
The reason is that neutral is difficult for stickman as most character will have either more range, or better rewards on neutral win than him.<br>
As such, your main tool that you should master is your mobility, which gives you the ability to mix-up your options with you 8 way air-dash and your great run and walk that you can cancel by shielding at any point (Stickman's run as a small start up where he can't shield though).<br>
You must use every tool that your mobility gives you and remain patient to find, or create, an oppening and then try to run your advantage state as long as you can.<br>
To remain in advantage don't forget what options your opponent has in defense and use your <span class="neutral">Ascend</span> when you know when they will try to escape but you don't know what <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> defensive options they will choose.<br>
Your low guard bar means that you don't have many chances to get out of pressure against most characters, which means you mustn't panic, as you need to make one good decision to get out and you need to be especially efficient, throwing options in defense without thinking will get you killed quickly, remember more than any other player other characters that, each time you do something to try to get out of pressure, you give your opponent a chance to pierce through your defenses.<br>
