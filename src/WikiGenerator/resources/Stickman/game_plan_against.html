<h2>Playing Against</h2>
To play against stickman, you must remain patient whether in neutral or in defense.<br>
They will likely try to skip the neutral phase as fast as they can, so that they can run their advantage, however due to their poor range they will have to take some risks to come to you and that is where you can punish them, they also deals poorly with projectiles due to their low ground jump.<br>
After all, stickman is extremely fragile and any repeated loss in neutral will have a great toll on him and will give you the necessary time to do any set up you may want to do.<br>
Also, try to remain in the air, simply because, if you block in the air you will be thrown far away (though you will lose a lot of ground so be careful, you don't want to put yourself in the corner) and if you're hit, stickman will have a hard time comboing you, especially without ressources.<br>
Use your parries and invincible/armored... moves in defense, as not only you might not be able to get out of their corner pressure otherwise, but also as they are sensitive to any <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> defensive options because of their <span class="neutral">Neutral</span> speciality which makes them mostly rely on <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> moves, However it also means that you must be careful of their <span class="neutral">Neutral</span> moves and <span class="neutral">Ascend</span>.
