	<h1>Cancel tree</h1>
	<h2>the different of type of moves</h2>
	Moves are categorized depending on their input, we will go over each types of move from bottom to top of the cancel tree.<br>
	first come <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> jabs, <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span>jabs are on 2<span class="not-typed">N</span>, 5<span class="not-typed">N</span> and j.5<span class="not-typed">N</span> inputs.<br>
	Those moves are repeatable and pretty fast as all jabs are but won't always give you the best rewards.<br>
	Then come <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> jabs which have similar properties except that thay are not repeatable, the inputs are 2X, 5X; j.5X (X being <span class="spirit">S</span>, <span class="matter">M</span>, <span class="void">V</span>).<br>
	After that we got <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> command normal.<br>
	<span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> command normal can be accessed with any input that is not already that of a jab, obviously, being <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> you need to use the <span class="not-typed">N</span> button.<br>
	Then there are <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> command normals and that's were the cancel tree gets more compicated.<br>
	Indeed <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> command normals can be canceled by other <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> command normals of the stronger type but you can only use a type once.<br>
	To simplify it means that you can cycle the typed button once you're using <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> command normal meaning you can do y<span class="spirit">S</span> -> y<span class="matter">M</span> -> y<span class="void">V</span> or y<span class="matter">M</span> -> y<span class="void">V</span> -> y<span class="spirit">S</span> or y<span class="void">V</span> -> y<span class="spirit">S</span> -> y<span class="matter">M</span> (y being any direction that won't result in a jab).<br>
	Command normals, <span class="spirit">Ty</span><span class="matter">p</span><span class="void">ed</span> or not, are what most of the input of a character are and except being generally slower than jabs, they are very diversified and learning what each of your command normals do, is a big part of mastering any character.<br>
	Specials, Special moves use command inputs (236,623,[4]6,63214...) and cost mana, from now on, the cancel tree won't be influenced by types.<br>
	Supers, Super moves cost more mana and also use command inputs.<br>
	Finally we got the ultimate which is always on 6321469874Z (Z being the main type that the character specialize in) a big move that cost all your mana (and can't be used without having at least 10% in each mana bars if you've used it previously in the game) all your overdrive gage and your guard gage.<br>
	Once the ultimate is used you lose your overdrive, your passive mana regeneration and your guard bar for the rest of the game, making it only usefull as a game ender most of the time.<br>
	The best way to learn this cancel is simply to learn your character combos and pressure strings, you will come to understand this cancel tree, however once your opponent or yourself want to diversify your defense/offense that is when understanding the finer details will help you.<br>
	Some rare moves break the cancel tree by being hit switch cancelable.<br>
	When a move has that property, it can be cancelled into another move that is at the same "level" of the cancel tree (example: stickman can cancel his 2N into his 5N and reverse because they are hit switch cancellable).<br>
	But it is important to note that most move with this property can only be cancelled into moves of their own "level" during their active frames and not after.
	<h2>In short</h2>
	<pre>5<span class="not-typed">N</span>       /5X            /y<span class="void">V</span> -> y<span class="spirit">S</span> -> y<span class="matter">M</span></pre>
	<pre>/j.5<span class="not-typed">N</span> -> /j.5X -> yN -> /y<span class="spirit">S</span> -> y<span class="matter">M</span> -> y<span class="void">V</span> -> any Special -> any Super -> Ultimate</pre>
	<pre>/2<span class="not-typed">N</span>      /2X            /y<span class="matter">M</span> -> y<span class="void">V</span> -> y<span class="spirit">S</span></pre>
	<br>
	X being <span class="spirit">S</span> or <span class="matter">M</span> or <span class="void">V</span><br>
	y being any direction that doesn't result in a jab (so j.2,j.3,j.6,j.8,3,6,8).
