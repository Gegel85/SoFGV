<h1>Typing System</h1>
    <h2>The types</h2>
	They are five elements/types in this game, firstly there are Spirit, Matter, Void.<br>
	They are each assigned to a button, respectively S, M and V.<br>
	In general moves of a types tend to follow certain trend. Which are:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Spirit moves: tend to have a lot of range and give a lot of mana, making them especially good in neutral.</li>
		<li>Void moves: tend to be fast and be generally usefull in advantage.</li>
		<li>Matter moves: tend to be slow, however they hit hard and are more likely to have armor or properties to cover their slowness.</li>
	</ul>
	then they are Non-typed and Neutral moves which are on the N button,<br>
	those moves tend to be less specialized than they're elemental counterparts and have more balanced characteristics in general.<br>
	However, what is described above are nothing but tendencies and depending on the character, might be more or less true.<br>
	Speaking of characters, each characters have one speciality among those elements (except Neutral).<br>
	Characters with certain type speciality will have more moves of said type.<br>
	Also some characters might have a secondary speciality were they will have a bit more moves of the corresponding type than normal.<br>
	<h2>The elemental wheel</h2>
	The "elemental wheel" describes which elements beats which, as you can see below it is pretty much a rock, paper, scissors<br>
	with Non-types losing or not interacting with other elements and Neutral winning against all but Non-typed.<br>

	The question then is where does this wheel is relevant? In effect it doesn't interact with most moves, as a Void move<br>
	will not necesserily "beat" a matter move however it does interact with some special properties of moves.<br>
	For example, invincibility and guard points are generally typed which means you can be hit during those moves by the stronger type.
	Moreover most system mechanics (mechanics common to all characters.) interact in some way or another with this wheel but we will develop that in the said mechanics sections.<br>
	Finally, should you care about learning the wheel if you're a new player?<br>
	No, not at all, though it is good too know it exists to not be too surprised when it comes into play,<br>
	it is only worth mastering for optimisation but ignoring it won't deprive you from any essential tool.
