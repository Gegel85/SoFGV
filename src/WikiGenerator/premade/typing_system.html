<h1>Typing System</h1>
    <h2>The types</h2>
	There are five elements/types in Spiral of Fate. Firstly there are <span class="spirit">Spirit</span>, <span class="matter">Matter</span> and <span class="void">Void</span>.<br>
	They are each assigned to a button, respectively S, M and V.<br>
	In general moves of a types tend to follow certain trend. Which are:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="spirit">Spirit</span> (<span class="spirit">S</span>) moves: tend to have a lot of range and give a lot of mana, making them especially good in neutral.</li>
		<li><span class="void">Void</span> (<span class="void">V</span>) moves: tend to be fast and be generally useful in advantage states.</li>
		<li><span class="matter">Matter</span> (<span class="matter">M</span>) moves: tend to be slow, however they hit hard and are more likely to have armor or properties to cover their slowness.</li>
	</ul>
	Then, there are <span class="not-typed">Non-typed</span> (<span class="not-typed">NT</span>) and <span class="neutral">Neutral</span> (<span class="neutral">N</span>) moves which are on the N button.
	Those moves tend to be less specialized than their elemental counterparts, and have more balanced characteristics in general.<br>
	However, what is described above are nothing but tendencies and depending on the character, might be more or less true.<br>
	Each character have one speciality among those elements. Characters with certain type speciality will have more moves of said type.<br>
	Also, some characters might have a secondary speciality, giving them access to more moves of that type than normal.<br>
	<h2>The elemental wheel</h2>
	The "elemental wheel" describes which elements beats which. As you can see below, it is pretty much a rock, paper, scissors, with <span class="not-typed">Non-Typed</span> losing or not interacting with other elements and <span class="neutral">Neutral</span> winning against all but <span class="not-typed">Non-typed</span>.<br>
	<img src="type-wheel.png" alt="type-wheel" height="256" width ="256"><br>
	In effect, the wheel doesn't interact with most moves, as a <span class="void">Void</span> move will not necessarily "beat" a <span class="matter">Matter</span> move. However, it does interact with some special properties of moves.<br>
	For example, invincibility and guard points are generally typed, which means you can be hit during those moves by the stronger type.<br>
	Moreover, most system mechanics (mechanics common to all characters.) interact in some way or another with this wheel, but we will develop that in the said mechanics sections.<br>
	But even if it is good to know that the wheel exists as to not be too surprised when it comes into play. It is only worth mastering for optimisation but ignoring it won't deprive you of any essential tool.
	<h2 id="status_effect">Type status effects</h2>
	When one takes a hit from any typed move (and whether they block it or not) they will be inflicted a status effect depending on the move type they've been hit by.<br>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="spirit">Spirit</span> drains your mana for the duration of the status effect.</li>
		<li><span class="void">Void</span> inflicts a dot that deal chip damage (this damage cannot kill).</li>
		<li><span class="matter">Matter</span> inflicts a dot that damage the guard bar.</li>
		<li><span class="neutral">Neutral</span> removes the typed properties of all your moves which are now considered <span class="not-typed">Non-typed</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="not-typed">Non-typed</span> doesn't inflict any status but it also won't replace or remove any status effect already in place.</li>
	</ul>
	When someone inflicted by a status effect is hit by another move of another type, the new status effect will replace the one already in place (except for <span class="not-typed">Non-typed</span>).<br>
	How long the status effect will linger depends on how high in the cancel tree the move that inflicted the status is (so jab don't inflict it for long ans things like specials or supers inflict it for much longer).
